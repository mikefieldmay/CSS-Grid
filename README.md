## CSS Grid example app

This is an app that gives an example of how the CSS grid system works and the various properties that you can customise. It was built in React using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a starting point.
Admittedly, it is not a particularly good use of css grid nor a particularly good example of a React app, but hopefully it can show some actual application of some of the grid properties.

You can view a live version of the app here: TODO Add Link

### How to use
```
  git clone https://github.com/mikefieldmay/CSS-Grid.git  
  cd CSS-Grid 
  npm install 
  npm start 
```
